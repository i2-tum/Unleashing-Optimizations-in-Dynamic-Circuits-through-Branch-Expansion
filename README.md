# Unleashing-Optimizations-in-Dynamic-Circuits-through-Branch-Expansion
Demo implementation of the idea proposed in the paper "Unleashing Optimizations in Dynamic Circuits through Branch Expansion"

Use jupyter notebook to run the code.

Run in the codeblocks in the following order: `branch-expansion.py`, `experiment-pattern-one.py`, `evaluate-pattern-one.py`, `draw-figure-14.py`, `draw-figure-15.py`, `prepare-experiment-on-pattern-two.py`, `draw-figure-16.py`, `draw-figure-17.py`.
